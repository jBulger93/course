Words in a sentence
------
Using JavaScript, add code to the function block below that takes the sentence parameter, and returns the number of words in that sentence. For the sake of this exercise, we will say that anything surrounded by a space " " is a word. You have completed the challenge when each `console.log`'s output matches the value in the comment (`//`) that follows.

```js
function numberOfWords (sentence) {
  // your code goes here
}

console.log(numberOfWords('How do you do?')) // 4
console.log(numberOfWords('She sells sea shells by the sea shore')) // 8
```

# Challenges

These are designed to make you think. There are no answers given, and no telling you what code to type. The idea is that you have to do your research and find a solution to the problem. 

Each page will have a challenge, and on a separate page there will be hints to help you solve that challenge (they're on a separate page to discourage you from using them, so please try and do each challenge without them).

## JSBin

For these challenges, please write your code in [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/?js,console). You should have a JavaScript pane open on the left, and a Console pane open on the right. When you have finished typing your JavaScript code, press the **Run** button. You should see the result of your `console.log` statements in the Console pane.

Why JSBin? We can execute JavaScript code in our Chrome developer tools, but to write multiple lines you have to remember to Shift+Enter. JSBin allows you to write JavaScript as if you were in your text editor, and you can view the output in the same window.
